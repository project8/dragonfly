# Quick Install

For the sake of an example, I'll assume the following:

1. You've activated the virtualenvironment you want to use
1. You've already installed the dripline in that virtualenv
1. You are currently in a directory where it is acceptable to place source

Simply install all remaining dependencies and dragonfly.
(Note this assumes you want all optional features enabled)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```
